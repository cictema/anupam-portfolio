Hi, I'm Anupam. I am a PhD student at the Department of Textile and Fibre Engineering, IIT Delhi, specializing in **shape memory coupled piezoelectric nanocomposites**. My work spans across piezoelectric/triboelectric nanogenerators, energy harvesting technologies, and advanced materials for flexible electronics and smart textiles.

I have extensive experience in:
- Synthesizing piezoelectric ceramics and polymer nanocomposites.
- Material characterization using XRD, SEM, FTIR, and Raman Spectroscopy.
- Fabrication techniques like melt extrusion, solution casting, and compression molding.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained extensive hands-on experience in material synthesis, polymer nanocomposites fabrication, and advanced characterization techniques. My work has led to several publications in reputable journals, reflecting my commitment to contributing to the field of sustainable materials and energy harvesting technologies.

In addition to my research, I have been involved in drafting technical standards for wearable electronic devices with the International Electrotechnical Commission and have collaborated with industry partners on specialized composite materials. My academic achievements have been recognized through various awards, including the Anundoram Barooah Award and the Engineering and Technology Scholarship by the Government of Assam.

I am passionate about advancing the frontiers of textile and polymer science, with a particular interest in the development of innovative materials for sustainable applications.

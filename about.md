Hi, I'm Anupam.

I am a dedicated Ph.D. student specializing in Textile and Fibre Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. My research focuses on the study of shape memory coupled piezoelectric nanocomposites, where I am deeply involved in the synthesis and characterization of advanced materials. With a strong academic background, including a Master of Technology in Polymer Science and Technology from Tezpur University and a Bachelor of Technology in Jute Technology from the University of Calcutta, I have developed a robust understanding of polymers, nanomaterials, and textile engineering.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained extensive hands-on experience in material synthesis, polymer nanocomposites fabrication, and advanced characterization techniques. My work has led to several publications in reputable journals, reflecting my commitment to contributing to the field of sustainable materials and energy harvesting technologies.

In addition to my research, I have been involved in drafting technical standards for wearable electronic devices with the International Electrotechnical Commission and have collaborated with industry partners on specialized composite materials. My academic achievements have been recognized through various awards, including the Anundoram Barooah Award and the Engineering and Technology Scholarship by the Government of Assam.

I am passionate about advancing the frontiers of textile and polymer science, with a particular interest in the development of innovative materials for sustainable applications.
